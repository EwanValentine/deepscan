# Deep Scan

![Deep Scan Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Deep scan is a highly performant network analysis tool. Deep scan can scan an ip range, and a port range to find open ports, active ip's and host names on a given network. 

The tool can be utilised in deep scan mode, which will scan an IP range, and a port range. Or focus mode, which will target a single IP address.

Deep scan is highly concurrent and will utilise all available cores, making deep scan highly performant.
